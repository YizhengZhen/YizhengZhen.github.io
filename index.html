    About me
</h1>

<p>
    My research focuses on quantum information theory and its application in experiments. Specifically, I am interested in 
	<ul>
		<li>Bell nonlocality and its application in quantum information processing;</li>
		<li>Energy and information cost in (quantum) information processing;</li>
		<li>Dicke model and its realization in microwave superconducting circuit environment.</li>
	</ul>
	My work involves a combination of analytical and numerical methods to explore how to understand quantum system/dynamics from the information perspective and how such understanding can be demonstrated/applied in experiments.
