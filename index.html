<h1>
    About me
</h1>

<p>
	<font size="5">My research focuses on quantum information theory and its application in experiments. Specifically, I am interested in
	<ul>
		<li>Bell nonlocality and its application in quantum information processing;</li>
		<li>Energy and information cost in (quantum) information processing;</li>
		<li>Dicke model and its realization in microwave superconducting circuit environment.</li>
	</ul>
	My work involves a combination of analytical and numerical methods to explore the understanding of quantum system/dynamics from the information perspective and how such understanding can be observed/demonstrated/applied in experiments.</font>
